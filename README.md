</p>
  This analysis examines the strengths of the PyCitySchools District and makes strategic recommendations based on key performance data. With the No Child Left Behind policy enactment, every district's goal is to ensure that all students are provided with the resources required to succeed in attaining core mathematical and reading skills, as measured by standardized performance examinations.  Each school and district strives to acheive the goal of a 70% passing rate for every student. This report will support the PyCitySchools District with identifying where district and school teams are not attaining this goal and frame conversations on next steps.

  While this data provides a powerful analysis examining results by school size, budget per student, and school type (District vs Charter).  Key social, professional staffing, and special education data is not incorporated into this report that would be critical in undertanding the nuances of this data required to make recommendations for improvements. However, this data analysis - as a high level framework, provides sufficient information to allow those additional questions to be contextualized and examined for additional analysis leading to district decisionmaking about strategic resource use.  
  The most notable findings are highlighted in this table:

### Key District Metrics, presented in table format

  In this analysis, we examine the analytical consequences of removing a group of 461 freshman students from Thomas High School.  Following concerns that some of the data is suspect, and the extent of the data issue is unknown,  the district would like to know how much exclusion of that data set from the District analysis will influence findings and decisionmaking. Data dashboards with reading and math data removed for 461 students will be noted as *Alternate*.
* District data remained largely unchanged.
* Percentage of students passing math and the overall students passing decreased by 1% point each.
